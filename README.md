## Overview

This project is a practical implementation of a full‑stack application designed to demonstrate clean architecture, core development skills, and real‑world problem solving. The focus is on functionality, readability, and maintainable code rather than unnecessary complexity.

The application includes user authentication, dynamic UI rendering, and basic CRUD operations. All features are implemented manually to reflect a clear understanding of the underlying concepts.


## Features Implemented

- User‑friendly interface with responsive design
- Authentication using email and password
- Create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations
- Client‑side validation and error handling
- Modular and reusable components
- Clean folder structure following best practices
